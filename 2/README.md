# Week 1 Assignment 2


TASK: Paste the python script we assembled in class that converts energy (in eV) to wavelength (in nm).

EXPECTED OUTCOME: As we have already finished in class, the code should take an input in eV using input(), convert it to nm, determine whether the wavelength corresponds to a red color (between 620 and 750 nm), and print the above results to inform a reader.
